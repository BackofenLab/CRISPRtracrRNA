# CRISPRtracrRNA: Robust approach for tracrRNA detection
The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a type II CRISPR system that has rapidly become the most versatile and widespread tool for genome engineering. It consists of two components, the Cas9 effector protein, and a single guide RNA that combines the spacer (for identifying the target) with the tracrRNA, a trans-activating small RNA required for both crRNA maturation and interference. While there are well-established methods for screening Cas effector proteins and CRISPR arrays, the detection of tracrRNA remains the bottleneck in detecting Class 2 systems.
Results: We introduce a new pipeline CRISPRtracer for screening and evaluation of tracrRNA candidates in genomes. This pipeline combines evidence from different components of the Cas9-sgRNA complex. The core is a newly developed structural model via covariance models from sequence-structure alignment of experimentally validated tracrRNAs. As additional evidence, we determine the terminator signal (required for the tracrRNA transcription) and the RNA-RNA interaction between the CRISPR array repeat and the 5â€™-tail of the tracrRNA. Repeats are detected via an ML-based approach (CRISPRidenifier). As additional evidence, we detect the cassette containing the Cas9 (type II CRISPR systems) and Cas12 (type V CRISPR systems) effector protein. Our tool is the first for detecting tracrRNA for type V systems.
